# Shoutbomb Extraction Script

This Python script is designed to extract library notice counts and the number of registered patrons for each library from a text file and generate a CSV output. It is tailored explicitly for internal use at the Electronic Information Network.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Place the input text file containing the library data in the same directory as the script. Update the `input_file` variable in the script with the correct file name or path.
3. Run the script using the command: `python Shoutbomb_extraction.py`
4. The script will extract the data from the input file and generate a CSV file with the extracted data. The output file name can be specified by updating the `output_file` variable in the script.

## Input File Format

The input text file should contain the library data in the following format:

窶義``
Library Name sent for the month, this many text notices = NoticeCount
Library Name has RegisteredPatrons registered patrons for text notices
窶義``

Example:
窶義``
Acme Lib (OPP) sent for the month, this many text notices = 19
Rodent Mound Lib (CLP) has 4 registered patrons for text notices
窶義``

## Output CSV Format

The script generates a CSV file with the following columns:
- Library: The name of the library
- NoticeCount: The count of text notices sent by the library for the month
- RegisteredPatrons: The number of registered patrons for text notices for the library

## Dependencies

This script has no external dependencies and only uses built-in Python modules (`re` and `csv`). Therefore, you don't need to install any additional packages or set up a virtual environment to run the script.

But go ahead and venv if you like.

## Roadmap

- [x] Extract notice counts and registered patrons from the input file
- [x] Generate a CSV output with the extracted data
- [ ] Add the ability to dump the entire raw data instead of only the desired output

## Wishlist??
- [ ] Add more statistical data
- [ ] Add data visualization
